# API, lifetime, and data ownership

English | [简体中文](api.zh-CN.md)

`Fizzy.McapSharp` provides synchronous MCAP file and Stream operations on .NET 8: Windows x64 and glibc Linux x64/ARM64, built against Ubuntu 22.04. macOS, musl and 32-bit processes are unsupported. Applications define payload encodings and nanosecond clock semantics. There is no asynchronous, cancellation, payload decoding or time-sorting API.

## Write a recording

`McapWriter(path, options)` creates a new file and refuses to overwrite it. `McapWriter(stream, options, leaveOpen: false)` accepts writable seekable or non-seekable streams. A seekable output must be positioned at its end; its current position becomes MCAP offset zero. Non-seekable output uses native chunk buffering.

```csharp
using Fizzy.McapSharp;

using var writer = new McapWriter(path, new() { Compression = McapCompression.Zstd });
var schema = writer.RegisterSchema("sample", "jsonschema", "{}"u8);
var channel = writer.RegisterChannel("/sample", "json", schema);
var header = new McapMessageHeader(channel, Sequence: 0, LogTime: 1000, PublishTime: 900);
writer.WriteMessage(in header, "{\"value\":42}"u8);
writer.Complete();
```

| Operation | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `RegisterSchema(name, encoding, data)` | Returns a native-allocated `ushort` ID; overload with leading `id` requests an explicit nonzero ID. Equivalent content can deduplicate. |
| `RegisterChannel(topic, messageEncoding, schemaId, metadata)` | Returns a channel ID; overload with leading `id` supports explicit IDs, including zero. Schema ID zero means no schema. Conflicting content for an existing ID fails. |
| `WriteMessage(in header, data)` | Writes to a registered channel using a message header and payload span. Consumes the input synchronously without a managed payload copy. |
| `WriteMetadata(name, metadata)` | Writes string key/value metadata. |
| `WriteAttachment(name, mediaType, logTime, createTime, data)` | Writes one attachment. |
| `StartAttachment(..., length)`, `WriteAttachmentBytes(data)`, `FinishAttachment()` | Writes an attachment in parts with an exact declared length. Other writer operations are rejected until completion. Length mismatch is terminal. |
| `WritePrivateRecord(opcode, data, includeInChunks)` | Accepts opcodes 0x80–0xFF; optionally writes inside chunks. |
| `Flush()` | Flushes the upstream writer, without completing the MCAP footer or guaranteeing durable storage. |
| `Complete()` | Finishes MCAP once. Files also receive `sync_all`; streams receive `Flush`, without a durability guarantee. Repeated successful calls are no-ops. |
| `GetSummary()` | Copies the upstream finish result after successful Complete; may allocate. |
| `Dispose()` | Releases resources without implicit Complete. |

Writer calls are serialized. Applications determine cross-thread business ordering. Native failures and Stream callback failures make the writer terminal: dispose it and begin a new recording. Argument/state checks before native operations do not by themselves fail a writer. Input buffers can be reused immediately after return.

### Writer options

| Option | Default / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Compression`, `ChunkSize`, `UseChunks` | None, 4 MiB, true. ChunkSize must be positive or null; null disables the target-size cutoff. |
| `Profile`, `Library` | Empty profile; null Library selects this library's native identifier. |
| `EmitSummaryOffsets`, `EmitStatistics` | true; independently control summary offsets and statistics. |
| `EmitMessageIndexes`, `EmitChunkIndexes`, `EmitAttachmentIndexes`, `EmitMetadataIndexes` | true; independently control each index type. |
| `RepeatChannels`, `RepeatSchemas` | null; upstream defaults (true). Control declarations repeated in the summary. |
| `CalculateChunkCrcs`, `CalculateDataSectionCrc`, `CalculateSummarySectionCrc`, `CalculateAttachmentCrcs` | true; independently control CRC computation. |
| `CompressionLevel`, `CompressionThreads` | null; upstream defaults and algorithm support. |

Nullable flags use upstream behavior when null. Summary content is selected through its individual record switches; there is no aggregate switch with override precedence. To omit summary records, disable statistics, chunk/attachment/metadata indexes and repeated declarations. Disable summary offsets separately. No chunks means no chunk compression or chunk message indexes, regardless of their requested settings. Options do not impose a unified memory quota.

## Read messages into reusable buffers

A file `McapReader` is a factory; constructing it does not open the file. Every `OpenMessages` or `OpenRecords` call owns a separate disposable `McapReadSession` and native handle. Dispose sessions or use `using`.

```csharp
using var session = new McapReader(path).OpenMessages(new() { Topic = "/sample" });
byte[] buffer = new byte[64 * 1024];
while (true)
{
    var status = session.ReadNext(buffer, out var header, out var length);
    if (status == McapReadStatus.EndOfStream) break;
    if (status == McapReadStatus.BufferTooSmall)
    {
        buffer = new byte[checked((int)length)]; // caller-chosen growth, outside zero-allocation contract
        continue;
    }
    // Process buffer.AsSpan(0, checked((int)length)) before reusing it.
}
```

`BufferTooSmall` returns the required payload length and message header, leaves the destination untouched and keeps the same record pending. Successful empty messages return `Message` with length zero. EOF is repeatable. Errors terminate message/record advancement. The API exposes no native addresses or borrowed spans.

Queries match the complete Topic string and apply `[StartTime, EndTime)` to LogTime. Null boundaries are unbounded; reversed boundaries throw, equal boundaries select nothing. Results retain file/chunk order. Seekable queries select overlapping indexed chunks when summary declarations and chunk coverage are sufficient and no top-level messages exist; otherwise they scan sequentially. Non-seekable queries always scan.

`GetChannel(id)` and `GetSchema(id)` copy descriptions already encountered or loaded from a summary. New declarations can appear during reading without creating managed objects in the message loop. IDs alone are returned on the hot path. Description lookup and summary operations allocate.

## Owned records, summaries and raw records

`ReadMessages`, `ReadSchemas`, `ReadChannels`, `ReadMetadata` and `ReadAttachments` provide convenient owned records. File-factory methods open independent sessions. Session convenience methods consume the current cursor; schema/channel/metadata/attachment methods require a record session. Message data and schema/attachment data are managed arrays and remain valid after disposal. Arrays are mutable. Message enumeration caches channel descriptions within that enumeration, so channel/schema objects may be shared between its messages.

`GetSummary()` returns a managed snapshot of statistics, chunk/attachment/metadata indexes and schema/channel IDs, or null if the file has no summary. Retrieve full declarations with session lookup methods. A writer's finish summary describes its in-memory recording result, even when summary records were disabled in the output.

`OpenRecords(McapRecordMode.TopLevel)` yields top-level records including encoded Chunk bodies. `ExpandChunks` replaces chunks with their decompressed records. `ReadNextRecord(destination, out opcode, out length)` follows the same retry contract as messages; `ReadRecords()` returns allocated `McapRecord` objects. The body excludes the opcode and eight-byte length prefix. Unknown/private record bodies are preserved.

On seekable sources, `ReadRecordAt(offset)`, `ReadChunk(index)` and `ReadMessageIndexes(index)` perform random reads without consuming the sequential cursor or pending record. Offsets are relative to the MCAP start. `ReadChunk` returns the raw Chunk record; `OpenRecords(ExpandChunks)` provides sequential decompression. Index entries contain chunk-relative message offsets. Raw random reads do not validate the whole file.

## Stream sessions and ownership

Use `McapReader.OpenMessages(stream, query, leaveOpen)` or `OpenRecords(stream, mode, leaveOpen)` for Stream input. The current stream position is MCAP offset zero. Sessions consume streams incrementally without a whole-stream copy or temporary file. A stream must contain exactly one MCAP from that position to its end.

Only one MCAP session can own a Stream at a time. Do not reposition, truncate, read, write or dispose it externally while the session is active. Stream callbacks run synchronously on the initiating thread; reentry into the same writer/session is rejected. Callback exceptions propagate after leaving native code. `leaveOpen` defaults to false; disposing a session closes its stream unless true.

Non-seekable streams do not support random reads or an early summary: those calls throw `NotSupportedException`. After a complete sequential scan, `GetSummary` returns the actual summary encountered, including null when absent. To restart or change reading modes, dispose the session and reopen/reposition the source yourself.

Mapped files must remain unchanged across reads, validation and recovery. Windows denies ordinary concurrent write/delete opens while mapped; pre-existing writable mappings are not covered. Linux does not enforce this exclusion. Concurrent truncation of a mapped file can terminate the process.

## Validation, recovery and allocation guarantees

File length is not used as a record or decompressed-chunk size limit. Highly compressed chunks can expand beyond the file size; native memory and upstream parser limits still apply.

`McapReader.Validate()` scans the whole file and checks record parsing, present Chunk/Attachment/Data/Summary CRCs, framing and final magic. It returns a scan record count, not a message count. CRC zero means no checksum was supplied; payload schema semantics are not checked.

Expanded sequential sessions validate as they advance. `ValidateRemaining()` drains such a session through EOF and returns the total scan count. `IsComplete` becomes true only after a successful full sequential scan. It stays false for indexed queries, top-level raw scans, early disposal and failures. A successful query is not full-file validation. Non-seekable validation and recovery use a single pass.

`RecoverMessages(accept)` delivers the valid prefix and stops at the first malformed record or chunk. Check its `IsComplete` and `Error`; delivered messages alone do not establish integrity. Callback exceptions propagate directly and are not recovery results. Buffers never written to the underlying stream cannot be recovered.

After initialization, registration and warm-up, normal `WriteMessage` and buffered `ReadNext` calls are required to allocate exactly zero managed bytes. This hard hot-path contract includes chunk/compression boundaries, newly encountered declarations, insufficient-buffer retries and EOF. This is not zero-copy reading: native data is copied into caller memory. It is not a promise that the process never collects or that Rust never allocates. Buffer growth, owned-record enumeration, description access, startup and errors are outside the guarantee. Arbitrary user Stream implementations can allocate internally; the guarantee covers the library's bridge, not those implementations.

Unsupported platforms throw `PlatformNotSupportedException`; native loading errors retain their .NET type. Native operation/ABI failures throw `McapException` (an `IOException`). Managed parameter/state checks use standard exceptions, and disposed objects throw `ObjectDisposedException`. See [ABI details](native.md) and [allocation acceptance and builds](development.md).
